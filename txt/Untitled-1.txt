if I'm ever saved, would you send me to Avalon
and if I end up at Big Sur I'll carry on
seems everything that I try never seems to go
just exactly the way that I might have hoped
if life is a game then I'm stuck on level one
girl, it's been days since I've seen that winter sun
I wish that you knew the way that I fell for you
I wish that you'd do for me what I'd do for you

it's the best news
the best news
for me
such a strange thing
strange thing
to be
if it drives me
up a wall
out to sea
well I don't know
no i don't know
why that could be

if I can write 8 lines out, and make them ryhme
and if they sound right to you, then i guess it's fine
got my head in the clouds and my neck in a noose
